= Welcome to Kwiki 2.0

Kwiki is wiki software that is especially popular in the Perl community.
It is of course written in Perl, but you don't need to be fluent in Perl
or even know what Perl is to start using a Kwiki wiki today.

One of the main advantages of Kwiki over other wiki software is that it
is comprised of lots of little software parts called plugins. There are
nearly 200 Kwiki plugins, with the number growing every day.

A plugin can change a Kwiki installation in any number of ways. The
effect can range from being simple as changing a color scheme to complex
as turning the wiki into a blog.

In practice, Kwiki installations end up looking and behaving very
different from each other, because a given installation is defined by
the set of plugins that the owner of the wiki is using.

There are plugins for almost anything you can think of, and even things
you probably haven't. If Kwiki doesn't have something you need, it isn't
too hard for you to write a plugin for yourself. Find a friendly Kwiki
hacker if you need help getting started.

== The Kwiki Vision

Kwiki is a great solution for those people who just want to install and
easily maintain a wiki site. But Kwiki is much more than that...

The vision of Kwiki is to be a software environment where
programmers can add to the framework as easily as a person would
edit a page on a wiki.

In an abstract sense, you can think of the Kwiki project as a wiki, and
each Kwiki plugin as a wiki page. Even though these plugins aren't open
for /everybody/ to edit, there is a strong sense of trust in the
community. Anyone who is interested (and generally trustworthy) can get
commit access to the project just by asking.

Kwiki encourages experimentation. No idea is too weird for Kwiki. There
are no inherent rules to follow. This makes Kwiki a hacker's playground.
Just be careful, or somebody might get an eye poked out.

Finally Kwiki doesn't make judgments on "Wiki Concepts". For instance,
Kwiki does not prefer CamelCaseLinks over [Free Links], or a file system
database over an RDBMS. Kwiki supports them all, with plugins for
everything. You could probably clone, say, MediaWiki (the Wikipedia wiki
software), using the right combination of Kwiki plugins.

The point is, if there is something about Kwiki that you don't
like, you don't need to convince the Kwiki community to change.
Just write a plugin!

= INSTALLATION

Kwiki is incredibly easy to set up. Kwiki bundles everything you need to
get up and running including an optional standalone web server. All you
need is a Unix environment with Perl of version 5.8.3 or higher.

Ready? You only need to do a few simple steps:

1) Get the Kwiki software.

Odds are, that since you are reading this, you already have done this
step. If not, you can get the software using one of these methods:

  A) svn checkout http://svn.2.kwiki.org/kwiki /usr/local/kwiki

     This is the preferred way to get the sources, since it makes
     getting updates as easy as `svn update`.

  B) svk checkout http://svn.2.kwiki.org/kwiki /usr/local/kwiki

     SVK is even better than SVN, but takes a little bit more time to
     get used to. It is the Hacker's Choice for version control.

  C) Download the latest Kwiki tarball from
     http://downloads.2.kwiki.org/ and untar it.

Kwiki does not have an install procedure. Once you have the software, it
is "installed". Just put it some nice, safe place like `/usr/local/kwiki`.

2) Put the `kwiki` command line utility in your PATH.

At the top level of your new Kwiki software is a directory called `bin`
which contains the command line utility called `kwiki`. This utility is
needed for managing the Kwiki software.

You should put this `bin` directory in your PATH environment setting. Use a
command like this in your login script:

    export PATH=/usr/local/kwiki/bin:$PATH

Now you can run `kwiki` commands in your shell.

NOTE: If you have already installed an older version of Kwiki, you may
      already have a `kwiki` script in your PATH. It is important that
      you put the new script in front of the older one in your PATH. Do
      a `which kwiki` command to make sure things are set up properly.

3) Run the command `kwiki -configure`.

You need to run this command once for each time you update the Kwiki
software. This command learns things about your system environment and
saves them in a place that Kwiki can access them from easily. It will
ask you a few questions.

To learn find out what questions it will ask you (so you can be prepared
to answer them) see http://2.kwiki.org/?KwikiConfigurationQuestions.

4) Create a new wiki with `kwiki -new`.

This command installs a Kwiki instance, which is a running wiki website.
You can either create a new directory, or specify the directory name in
the command.

    cd /path/to/cgi/
    mkdir kwikii-01
    cd kwiki-01
    kwiki -new

or (more simply):

    kwiki -new /path/to/cgi/kwiki-01

5) Start a web server with `kwiki -start`.

Kwiki comes with its own lightweight web server. To start running your new
Kwiki instance, go into its directory and run `kwiki -start`. Or optionally
specify the directory on the command:

    kwiki -start /path/to/cgi/kwiki-01

This is the easy way to get going, but for a real wiki on the Web,
you'll probably want to use a "real" web server. In this case, just make
sure your webserver is running and knows about your Kwiki.

You can use any CGI enabled web server to run Kwiki. Apache and Lighttpd
are popular choices. Just put your new Kwiki instance directory in a
place where the web server expects to have Perl CGI programs. This may
or may not require configuration changes to your web server.

6) You are done!!!

Well at least you got a Kwiki up and running. :-) See the next section
for advice on configuring and maintaining your new Kwiki.

== Installation Command Line Synopsis

In review, basically just do these commands:

  > svk checkout http://svn.2.kwiki.org/kwiki /usr/local/kwiki
  > export PATH=/usr/local/kwiki/bin:$PATH
  > kwiki -configure
  > kwiki -new /path/to/cgi/kwiki-01
  > kwiki -start /path/to/cgi/kwiki-01

This top level Makefile is to help Kwiki developers generate all the Kwiki
symlink trees when adding new stuff to Kwiki.

This Makefile is not needed for installation of Kwiki. Read the INSTALL
document for help with that.

Avalable Makefile targets are:

    help - This file
    all_links - Generate all the symlink trees

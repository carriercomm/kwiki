== INSTALLING A KWIKI INSTANCE

This is the directory where your Kwiki wiki instance(s) will reside.
Copy the directory called "sample" to a name of your choice. Change into
that directory and run the command "make". That's all you need to do.

    > cp -r sample my-kwiki
    > cd my-kwiki
    > make

== NOTES

* Before running "make" be sure you have run "perl Configure.pl" at the
  top level. (You should see a "config.mk" file at the top level)
* Make sure your web server exposes your instance directory(s) as CGI.

Kwiki (V1) was originally envisioned to be a Perl based Wiki system where each component of the system was a plugin, and plugins could do just about anything.

----

In KwikiV3, plugins are still very important, but we want to build a more solid foundation, so that people can build even better plugins.

V3 Has the following design goals:

= Kwiki is a Wiki

In the past, Kwiki was pretty much about experimentation in the guise of being a wiki. In the future, Kwiki will focus on being a very solid wiki for people who simply want a great wiki.

= Kwiki is Markup Agnostic

All wikis seem to have their own WikiTextMarkup. WikiCreole is an attempt to make a standard. Kwiki just has WikiPages. You can request these pages in any number of formats including:

* XHTML
* WikiwygHtml
* KwikiV1Format
* KwikiV3Format
* MediaWikiFormat

etc...

You can edit and store pages in any of these formats. Kwiki will be the first wiki to serve pages in any format.

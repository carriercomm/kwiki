= The Kwiki Hackathon Wiki

The first ever Kwiki hackathon is happening on February 17th at Noon PST (GMT-8).

HackathonParticipants will be meeting on irc in #kwiki on irc.freenode.net.

We will be working on projects listed on http://pi.kwiki.org?KwikiHackathonAgenda. All the important information is on http://pi.kwiki.org which is running V3. This wiki (http://hackathon.kwiki.org) is running V1 for some features that are not yet in V3.

If you have a webcam, go to KwikiVawkr to see and talk to the other hackers.

We are using SubEthaEdit to edit the http://pi.kwiki.org and http://hackathon.kwiki.org pages for a while so we can do it collaboratively. Try see://freepan.org/

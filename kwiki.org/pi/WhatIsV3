Kwiki V1 was not really called V1 before, but that's what we call it now. It's the old Kwiki code. V1 is still supported and is still the default for a new wiki.

V2 was started in Dec 2006. It was the start of a major refactoring of Kwiki. We made it so that everything you need to run a Kwiki was contained in the svn repo (except Perl itself of course). V2 was put on hold when Ingy had the scooter accident in Taiwan in Aril 2007.

V3 started in Feb 2008 and is picking up where V2 left off. See [[KwikiDesignGoals]] for more info.

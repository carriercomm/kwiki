Our strategy for moving forward is to start completely from scratch with markup, using 100% unadulterated [[WikiCreole]] as our starting point, then gradually migrating to [[WikiKreole]] (Creole with our recommended improvements), and finally implementing [[K3MarkupLanguage]], which adds whatever greatness we want to add that Creole doesn't cover.

Unfortunately, it's hard to implement [[WikiCreole]] exactly, because it's a bit underspecified and there are some lingering issues, which we're capturing at [[WikiCreoleIssues]].

Our guidelines for implementing Creole are:

* If it's unimplementable, don't implement it.
* If it's poorly thought out but implementable, implement it, and do it better in [[WikiKreole]].

== Creole Things We're Not Implementing

* links in any order
* tildes in unbracketed external links
* auto-terminating bold, italics, and nowiki at the end of a paragraph. If there's no termination, we won't assume any formatting at all.

== Kwiki is a Wiki

In the past, the main focus of Kwiki was to be this Cowboy Framework. Anybody could write a plugin and it should JustWork with any other plugins.

That's still a good idea but now I want to start building wiki features into Kwiki.

== Let Kwiki Be Kwiki

Kwiki 2 did important work to all Kwiki 1 to still work while making massive changes to certain things.

Kwiki 3 will make these massive changes.

I want to end up where most/many of the old plugins still work. Many plugins will go away simply because they will become core features.

== Pages are REST Objects

Pages and other useful objects in the system will all be available via RESTful uris.

== Pages are available in many wikitext formats.

Pages are pages. The wikitext doesn't matter. You can request/store any page in any supported wikitext format. Like mediawiki, creole or classic kwiki.  See [[Kwiki3Markup]].

== Transclusions Rock

We want to support [[Transclusion]]s, because they're bad ass and useful.

Kwiki (V1) was originally envisioned to be a Perl based Wiki system where each component of the system was a plugin, and plugins could do just about anything.

----

In KwikiV3, plugins are still very important, but we want to build a more solid foundation, so that people can build even better plugins.

V3 Has the following design goals:

= Kwiki is a Wiki

In the past, Kwiki was pretty much about experimentation in the guise of being a wiki. In the future, Kwiki will focus on being a very solid wiki for people who simply want a great wiki.

= Let Kwiki Be Kwiki

Kwiki 2 did important work to all Kwiki 1 to still work while making massive changes to certain things.

Kwiki 3 will make these massive changes.

I want to end up where most/many of the old plugins still work. Many plugins will go away simply because they will become core features.

= Kwiki is Markup Agnostic

All wikis seem to have their own WikiTextMarkup. WikiCreole is an attempt to make a standard. Kwiki just has WikiPages. You can request these pages in any number of formats including:

* XHTML
* WikiwygHtml
* KwikiV1Format
* KwikiV3Format
* MediaWikiFormat

etc...

You can edit and store pages in any of these formats. Kwiki will be the first wiki to serve pages in any format.

= Pages are REST Objects

Pages and other useful objects in the system will all be available via RESTful uris.

= Transclusions Rock

We want to support [[Transclusion]]s, because they're bad ass and useful.

= FAST START

Basically just do these commands:

  > svn checkout http://svn.kwiki.org/kwiki/trunk /usr/local/kwiki
  > export PATH=/usr/local/kwiki/bin:$PATH
  > kwiki -new /path/to/cgi/kwiki-01

If you want to use the builtin web server:

  > kwiki -start /path/to/cgi/kwiki-01 --port=8080

Point your browser at the new Kwiki:

  > open http://localhost:8080/index.cgi

= INSTALLATION DETAILS

Kwiki is incredibly easy to set up. Kwiki bundles everything you need to
get up and running including an optional standalone web server. All you
need is a Unix environment with Perl of version 5.8.3 or higher.

Ready? You only need to do a few simple steps:

1) Get the Kwiki software.

Odds are, that since you are reading this, you already have done this
step. If not, you can get the software using one of these methods:

  A) svn checkout http://svn.kwiki.org/kwiki/trunk /usr/local/kwiki

     This is the preferred way to get the sources, since it makes
     getting updates as easy as `svn update`.

  B) svk checkout http://svn.kwiki.org/kwiki/trunk /usr/local/kwiki

     SVK is even better than SVN, but takes a little bit more time to
     get used to. It is the Hacker's Choice for version control.

  C) Download the latest Kwiki tarball from
     http://downloads.kwiki.org/ and untar it.

Kwiki does not have an install procedure. Once you have the software, it
is "installed". Just put it some nice, safe place like `/usr/local/kwiki`.

2) Put the `kwiki` command line utility in your PATH.

At the top level of your new Kwiki software is a directory called `bin`
which contains the command line utility called `kwiki`. This utility is
needed for managing the Kwiki software.

You should put this `bin` directory in your PATH environment setting. Use a
command like this in your login script:

    export PATH=/usr/local/kwiki/bin:$PATH

Now you can run `kwiki` commands in your shell.

NOTE: If you have already installed an older version of Kwiki, you may
      already have a `kwiki` script in your PATH. It is important that
      you put the new script in front of the older one in your PATH. Do
      a `which kwiki` command to make sure things are set up properly.

3) Create a new wiki with `kwiki -new`.

This command installs a Kwiki instance, which is a running wiki website.
You can either create a new directory, or specify the directory name in
the command.

    cd /path/to/cgi/
    mkdir kwiki-01
    cd kwiki-01
    kwiki -new

or (more simply):

    kwiki -new /path/to/cgi/kwiki-01

4) Start a web server with `kwiki -start`.

Kwiki comes with its own lightweight web server. To start running your new
Kwiki instance, go into its directory and run `kwiki -start`. Or optionally
specify the directory on the command:

    kwiki -start /path/to/cgi/kwiki-01 --port=8080

This is the easy way to get going, but for a real wiki on the Web,
you'll probably want to use a "real" web server. In this case, just make
sure your web server is running and knows about your Kwiki.

You can use any CGI enabled web server to run Kwiki. Apache and Lighttpd
are popular choices. Just put your new Kwiki instance directory in a
place where the web server expects to have Perl CGI programs. This may
or may not require configuration changes to your web server.

5) You are done!!!

Well at least you got a Kwiki up and running. :-) See the next section
for advice on configuring and maintaining your new Kwiki.

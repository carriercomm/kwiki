NAME
    Kwiki::PagePrivacy - Kwiki Page Privacy Plugin

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    Kwiki::PagePrivacy is a plugin that lets you mark individual pages as:

        * Public - normal readable/writable
        * Protected - readonly to everyone except the control group.
        * Private - invisible to everyone but the control group.

    By control group I mean that there are multiple entry points or "views" into the kwiki and the view has an associated permissions group. 

    Visit http://www.kwiki.org/?AdminView for how to build separate views for your kwiki.

    Don't forget to secure the admin view with something like Apache's .htaccess files. You only want people who are admins setting the privacy levels.

12:42 < fmerges> the thing about going to use SVN as standard is good
12:43 < fmerges> In my opinion, I would get emphasis on the user 
                 authentication/authorization aspect
12:43 < fmerges> and I think a plugin for writing technical documentation would 
                 be great
12:44 < fmerges> using wafls would be ok... mean {doc:toc} or something..
12:44 < fmerges> the normal presentation and the print friendly is ok, but what 
                 about PDF output?
12:45 < fmerges> would be simple a plugin that uses htmldoc to translate the 
                 html to pdf, I use it on our website and works perfect...
12:46 < fmerges> the major thing I find is speed, SpeEd, SPEEEEDD :DD
12:48 < fmerges> when we speak about facilities to create technical 
                 documentations output, comes to the spork integration, I think                  spork is great, it makes presentation ejoyable, would also be 
                 great to have this integ.
12:52 < fmerges> I think blog is also in some way important, I see it on my 
                 company, people want to have a place where they can put they 
                 things, extending the Kwiki::Privacy to a user would be great
12:52 < fmerges> Page deleting

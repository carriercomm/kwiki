NAME
      Kwiki::Session - Session support in your Kwiki plugin

SYNOPSIS
        # Install Kwiki::Session as a plugin
        > kwiki -add Kwiki::Sesssion

        # Return a CGI::Session object
        my $session = $self->hub->session->load;

DESCRIPTION
    This class help out when a Kwiki plugin writer wants session support. It
    has only one method called "load", which will automatically recover the
    correct session id, and create one if necessary. "load" method returns a
    "CGI::Session" object, so please read the documentation in CGI::Session
    in order to use this object.

    Please that, this module itself is also a kwiki plugin, and has to be
    installed to your kwiki site if you want your own module to use it very
    easily. If you put "Kwiki::Session" in your "plugins" file, you can just
    use this line to retrieve your session:

        my $session = $self->hub->session->load;

    Otherwise, it would take like this long to load it:

        sub init {
            $self->hub->config->add_field('session' => 'Kwiki::Session');
        }

    For simple purpose, just put "Kwiki::Session" into your "plugins" file.
    It doesn't provide any extra actions or widgets or any templates, just
    convienent access programming interface.

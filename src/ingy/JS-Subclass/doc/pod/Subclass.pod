Subclass - Simple Javascript Subclassing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    proto = Subclass('Project.Foo');

    proto.something = function(x, y) {
        ...
    }


    proto = Subclass('Project.Bar', 'Project.Foo') {

    proto.somthing = function(x, y) {
        ...
        this.superfunc('something').apply(arguments);
        ...
    }

    proto.other = function(a, b) {
        ...
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Subclass is a function that generates a class; optionally as a subclass
of another class.

By "class", we mean that Subclass generates a constructor, puts it in
the correct namespace, and returns the constructor's prototype.

It's that simple. Subclass does not try to be an entire framework for
Javascript. It's just a small tool that does one thing well.

Subclass does add 3 properties to each class though: C<classname>,
C<superclass> and C<superfunc>. The latter is a function that can be
used to find a super function at runtime.

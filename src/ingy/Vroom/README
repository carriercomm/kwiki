NAME
    Vroom - Slide Shows in Vim

SYNOPSIS
        > vim vroom         # Write Some Slides
        > vroom vroom       # Compile Your Slides
        > cd slides         # Go To Your Slides
        > vim *             # Show Your Slides

DESCRIPTION
    Ever given a Slide Show and needed to switch over to the shell?

    Now you don't ever have to switch again. You're already there.

    Vroom lets you create your slides in a single file using a Wiki-like
    style, much like Spork and Sporx do. The difference is that your slides
    don't compile to HTML or JavaScript or XUL. They get turned into a set
    of files in a directory called "slides".

    The slides are named in alpha order. That means you can bring them all
    into a Vim session with the command: "vim *".

    Vroom creates a file called "slides/.vimrc" with many helpful key
    mappings for navigating a slideshow. See "KEY MAPPINGS" below.

    Vroom takes advantage of Vim's syntax highlighting. It also lets you run
    slides that contain code.

    Since Vim is an editor, you can change your slides during the show.

KEY MAPPINGS
    <SPACE>
        Advance one slide

    <BACKSPACE>
        Go back one slide

    <R> Run current slide as Perl

    <Q> Quit Vroom

    <h3 id="2.2"> 2.2 System Architecture </h3>
    <p> The system uses Xen virtualization software to run three virtual systems. Xen is an open source virtualization solution which supports a wide range of virtual operating systems including Windows, Linux, Solaris, and various versions of the BSD operating systems. It is theorically possible to run all mentioned operating systems on Xen, but due to the host OS and hardware, it is simply more difficult to get some operating systems working well than others, for example, I could not run FreeBSD well on a Debian-based Xen box. But there are more success stories about running Windows and Linux on Xen.</p>
    <p>The base operating system (called Dom0 in Xen) is Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 (a.k.a Debian Etch), the virtual systems (called DomU in Xen) running on it are two Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and one Debian Etch. The respective operating systems are listed in the table below:</p>

    <h2 id="#ch3">Chapter 3: System Installation</h2>
    <p>This chapter describes the system-level configurations and how to install required operating systems on oolong.</p>
    <h3 id="3.1">3.1 RAID System</h3>
    <p>oolong uses RAID 1 (one-to-one mirror) backup, so the actually available HDD space is 143 GB, the other HDD is for mirroring. To modify the RAID configuration, press <strong>Ctrl+R</strong> to enter the PERC 5/i controller utility at booting.</p>
    <h3 id="3.2">3.2 Debian Etch Installation</h3>
    <p>To install Debian Etch, download the CD/DVD image from <a href="http://ftp.funet.fi/pub/linux/mirrors/debian-cdimage/">http://ftp.funet.fi/pub/linux/mirrors/debian-cdimage/</a>. No special tweaks are required during the installation process, network card and RAID controller are automatically detected and activated. But the network driver has to be upgraded and the network configuration has to be modified after installation.</p>
    <h4 id="3.2.1">3.2.1 Network Interface Card Configuration</h4>
    <p>Dell PE1950 present their onboard network cards as Gb1 and Gb2 in BIOS, but these map to eth1 and eth0 respectively ("backwards") under Linux. This issue is fixed in kernel 2.6.19-rc3 and higher. But the current kernel of oolong is kernel 2.6.18-5, so manually changing the network card configurations is necessary. In our case, the default dhcp configuration will assign IP addresses and Hostnames to each network card as following:</p> 
        <table class="spec-table">
        	<caption>Fig4. Ethernet Card Configurations</caption>
            <tr>
                <th>Mac address</th>
                <th>Card name</th>
                <th>IP</th>
                <th>Hostname</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>00:19:B9:EB:BE:85</td>
                <td>eth1</td>
                <td>153.1.17.26</td>
                <td>oolong.uta.fi</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>00:19:B9:EB:BE:87</td>
                <td>eth0</td>
                <td>153.1.17.22</td>
                <td>oolong1.uta.fi</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    <p>This is different from our expectation: eth0 as oolong.uta.fi and eth1 as oolong1.uta.fi. The solution is to switch the network mac address,  make 00:19:B9:EB:BE:85 become eth0's mac address and 00:19:B9:EB:BE:87 become eth1s'. To change mac address information, edit <strong>/etc/udev/rules.d/z25_persistent-net.rules.</strong> The modified file is as below: </p>
    <blockquote><pre>
# This file was automatically generated by the /lib/udev/write_net_rules
# program, probably run by the persistent-net-generator.rules rules file.
#
# You can modify it, as long as you keep each rule on a single line.
# MAC addresses must be written in lowercase.

# PCI device 0x14e4:0x164c (bnx2)
SUBSYSTEM=="net", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTRS{address}=="00:19:b9:eb:be:87", NAME="eth1"

# PCI device 0x14e4:0x164c (bnx2)
SUBSYSTEM=="net", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTRS{address}=="00:19:b9:eb:be:85", NAME="eth0"
	</pre></blockquote>
	<p>In this way, we can guarantee that dhcp will assign correct IP to each ethernet network card. <strong>/etc/udev/rules.d/z25_persistent-net.rules</strong> is automatically generated at first time startup, after that, it will be modified if there are new interfaces hardware added to the system, but the existing content will remain the same. So unless you reinstall the system or manually modify the existing content, otherwise, the configuration file will not be changed. More information about <strong>/etc/udev/rules.d/z25_persistent-net.rules</strong> can be found at <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/udev?highlight=%28persistent-net-generator%29">Debian Wiki udev</a>.</p>
    <h4 id="3.2.2">3.2.2 Add Ethernet Network Card</h4>
    <p>Only one network card is detected and activated at installation, so we have to manually add and configure another ethernet card. For a detail document on how to configure network on Debian, refer to <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/NetworkConfiguration?highlight=%28interface%29%7C%28network%29%7C%28name%29">Debian Wiki - NetworkConfiguration</a>. The network interface configuration file is <strong>/etc/network/interfaces</strong>, the current content is as following:</p>
    <blockquote><pre>
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
auto eth0
allow-hotplug eth0
# iface eth0 inet dhcp
iface eth0 inet static
address 153.1.17.22
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 153.1.17.5

auto eth1
allow-hotplug eth1
# iface eth1 inet dhcp
iface eth1 inet static
address 153.1.17.26
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 153.1.17.5

up /sbin/iptables-restore /etc/network/iptable
    </pre></blockquote>
    <p>Although as mentioned in 3.2.1 that dhcp works, I personally perfer specifying network configuration information manually, just a double check. Besides the default eth0, eth1 and its configurations are added to the file. The last line <strong>up /sbin/iptables-restore /etc/network/iptable</strong> activates the firewall. After changing <strong>/etc/network/interfaces</strong>, it is required to restart the network to make the new configuration working. To relaunch the network, run <i>/etc/init.d/networking restart</i> with root permission.</p>
    <h4 id="3.2.3">3.2.3 Upgrade Network Driver</h4>
    <p>The original Broadcom NetXtreme II network card driver (bnx2 v1.4.44) that comes with Debian Etch can not work properly on Xen, this issue is solved in version 1.5.10c, so the network card driver  has to be upgraded to at least or higher than 1.5.10c. To download the latest driver, visit <a href="http://www.broadcom.com/support/ethernet_nic/netxtremeii.php">http://www.broadcom.com/support/ethernet_nic/netxtremeii.php</a>, or there is a copy of bnx2 1.5.10c driver at <strong>//arnika/laitos$/hyper/Projektit/Gamelab/Server_documents/PE1950</strong>. Refer to the <a href="http://lists.xensource.com/archives/html/xen-users/2007-10/msg00176.html">xensource mailing list</a> for the detail instructions. The complete email content is copied as below:</p>
    <blockquote><pre>
I have a new x3655 IBM and whenever the /etc/xen/scripts/network-bridge
script starts, the ethernet would no longer work.  This post isn't about
the cause, but the fix.  I did a lot of tcpdumps and Googling, but I'll
spare you that.  All they do is prove that yes, there is an issue. :)

I tried Debian 4.0 i386/amd64 and Ubuntu 7.04 Server i386/amd64 and they
all exhibit the problem.

Upgrading the bnx2 driver is the key.  I came to find bnx2 is included
in the initrd.  Debian comes with 1.4.44 and Ubuntu 1.4.45 of the
driver.  As of this writing 1.5.10c is the latest from Broadcom and is
what I ended up using.
	
Summary:
* Install kernel source, make config/prepare the distro's config file
* Download bnx2 source, compile and install
* Update initrd

Here are step by step instructions for clean install of Debian 4.0 amd64:

aptitude install linux-source unzip
cd /usr/src
tar jxf linux-source-2.6.18.tar.bz2
ln -s linux-source-2.6.18 linux
cd linux
cp /boot/config-2.6.18-5-xen-amd64 ./.config
make oldconfig (<enter> through all the prompts to take defaults)
make prepare
cd /tmp
wget http://www.broadcom.com/docs/driver_download/NXII/linux-1.5.10c.zip
unzip linux-1.5.10c.zip
cp Server/Linux/Driver/bnx2-1.5.10c.tar.gz /usr/src
cd /usr/src
tar zxf bnx2-1.5.10c.tar.gz
cd bnx2-1.5.10c/src
make
make install
mv /boot/initrd.img-2.6.18-5-xen-amd64 \
/boot/initrd.img-2.6.18-5-xen-amd64.orig
update-initramfs -k `uname -r` -c
reboot

    <h3 id="3.3">3.3 Xen Installation</h3>
    <p>To install Xen, follow the <a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/debian_etch_xen_3.1">The Perfect Xen 3.1.0 Setup For Debian Etch (i386)</a> on Howtoforge. My experience with installing Xen from the <a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/debian_etch_xen_3.1_p2">binary package</a> and from source all went smoothly, so the installation should not be a problem. The major difference between binary package and source is the ability to compile kernel for the virtual system. If you prefer customizing kernels for different virtual systems, you should install Xen from source. That is what I did to oolong. In The Perfect Xen 3.1.0 Setup For Debian Etch (i386), <a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/debian_etch_xen_3.1_p5">Page 5</a> and <a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/debian_etch_xen_3.1_p6">Page 6</a> decribe how to install Xen 3.1 from source step-by-step. Be sure to double check the driver version of the network card after Xen is installed, it must be higher than bnx2 1.5.10c.</p>
    <p>If you plan to compile a new kernel for virtual system, besides enabling <strong>quota</strong> and <strong>iptables</strong> as modules in the kernel configuration menu (as mentioned in <a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/debian_etch_xen_3.1_p5">Page 5</a>), you also have to enable <strong>SMB</strong> and <strong>CIFS</strong> network file systems support, otherwise, the system can not connect to our network hard disk drive. In the kernel configuration menu, you can find <strong>SMB</strong> and  <strong>CIFS</strong> options at:</p>

 	<h2 id="ch4">Chapter 4: Xen Configuration</h2>
 	 <p>All Xen-related configuration and scripting files are placed in <strong>/etc/xen</strong>, <strong>xend-config.sxp</strong> is the core Xend configuration file.</p>
    <h3 id="4.1">4.1 Base system (Dom) Configurations</h3>
    <p>As a host of all other virtual machines, Dom0 itself does not run any particular services, only OpenSSL server so we can ssh to it. We need to configure the network so that Dom0 can provide network for all DomU and keep itself safe from unknown connections at the same time.</p> A basic introduction to Xen network can be found at <a href="http://wiki.xensource.com/xenwiki/XenNetworking">http://wiki.xensource.com/xenwiki/XenNetworking</a>.
    <h4 id="4.1.1">4.1.1 Network Configuration</h4>
    <p>Xen provides two types of networking: bridging and routing, oolong uses bridging. For security reason, Dom0 does not share ethernet network card with DomUs. There are two ethernet network cards on oolong, eth0 is for Dom0, eth1 is for DomUs. The figure is illustrated as following:</p>
    <div class="image"><img src="network.png" alt="The network configuration of oolong" height="300" width="400" /></div>
    <p>To achieve above configuration, we do not use the default xend network configuration in xend-config.sxp. Instead, we create our own network bridge script and add it to xend-config.sxp. Open <strong>/etc/xen/xend-config.sxp</strong>, find the line <strong>(network-script oolong-network)</strong>, <strong>oolong-network</strong> is the network bridge script created for our needs, you can replace this script with any other scripts you create for oolong.</p>
    <p>All xen-related scripts are placed in <strong>/etc/xen/scripts</strong>, in <strong>/etc/xen/scripts</strong>, there is a file called <strong>oolong-network</strong>, the content is very simple:</p>
    <blockquote><pre>
dir=$(dirname "$0")
"$dir/network-bridge" "$@" vifnum=0 netdev=eth1 bridge=xenbr1
    </pre></blockquote>
    <p>It merely calls the network-bridge script with vifnum=0 netdev=eth1 bridge=xenbr1 as parameters, then network-bridge will do the magic for us.</p> With those parameters, we specify eth1 as the network interface for DomU, and specify the name of bridge as xenbr1. A detailed example article can be found at <a href="http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/470">http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/470</a>.</p>
    <h4 id="4.1.2">4.1.2 Firewall Configuration</h4>
    <p>Besides the firewall settings in the university firewall, there are also firewall running on Dom0. The policy is: Dom0 is only accessible via eth0 (153.1.17.22/oolong.uta.fi), access to Dom0 via eth1 (153.1.17.26/oolong1.uta.fi) is not allowed. It is valid connecting to DomUs from Dom0, but connecting to Dom0 from DomUs is not allowed.</p>
    <p>By now, only 153.1.17.87/oolong3.uta.fi is open for external http connection requests (port 80 and 443), other IPs are not open to the  network outside our university, so they are only accessible from within the university network.</p>
    <p>The firewall tool running on Dom0 is iptables, iptables is a firewall tool and is also a command to manage iptables rules in Linux. Use command <i>man iptables</i> to learn how to use iptables. After changing iptables rules, you can save the rules by using <i><a href="http://iptables-tutorial.frozentux.net/iptables-tutorial.html#IPTABLES-SAVE">iptables-save</a></i>. The iptables rules will be saved to <strong>/etc/network/iptable</strong>, and they will be automatically loaded when boot, so that you don't have to set up iptables rules every time. If you plan to change iptables rules, do not change <strong>/etc/network/iptable</strong> directly, instead, you should use <i>iptables</i> command, after you are sure the iptables rules work as expected, use <i>iptables-save</i> to save the rules. Before saving new iptables rules to <strong>/etc/network/iptable</strong>, you should back up the current one. The current iptables rules on oolong is as below:</p>
    <blockquote><pre>
# Generated by iptables-save v1.3.6 on Wed Jan 23 17:33:16 2008

	<p>What those rules do are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The default INPUT policy is DROP.</li>
        <li>If the input connection request is received from eth0 and the destination is to 153.1.17.22, the connectio request is accepted.</li>
        <li>If the input connection request is a reponse to a related or established output connections to eth1, the connection request is accepted.</li>
        <li>Any input connection requests other than the above two, are dropped by default.</li>

    <h3 id="4.2">4.2 Virtual system (DomU) Configurations</h3>
    <p>xen-tool is used to create DomU images, a global configuration file (<strong>xen-tools.conf</strong>) is places in <strong>/etc/xen-tools/</strong>. Values can be set in this file so they don't need to be specified everytime upon the command line. The command to create a DomU image is <i>xen-create-image</i>, take oolong3.uta.fi for example, the command is:</p>
    <i>xen-create-image --hostname=oolong3.uta.fi --ip=153.1.17.87 --dist=etch --mirror=http://ftp.fi.debian.org/debian/ --size=30Gb</i>
    <p>Other parameters required for creating DomU images are specified in <strong>/etc/xen-tools/xen-tools.conf</strong>. You can also overwrite the values by specifying them upon the command line. <i>xen-create-image</i> creates the DomU image and configuration file for every created DomU image.</p>
   <p>The configuration file of every DomU image are stored at <strong>/etc/xen/*.cfg</strong>. To make the network working, one line has to be modified for every .cfg file. In each .cfg file, there is a block like:</p>
    <blockquote><pre>
#
#  Networking
#
vif  = [ 'ip=<your IP>,bridge=xenbr0' ]
    </pre></blockquote>
    <p>Make sure the IP address is correct, then change the <strong>bridge=xenbr0</strong> to <strong>bridge=xenbr1</strong>. In our configurations, the name of the bridge is xenbr1 not xenbr0.</p>
    <p>This table lists the major configuration parameters of every DomU:</p>

    <h3 id="6.2">6.2 Apache Configuration</h3>
    <p>We use Apache virtual host feature to host different website with different domain names, each website has its own configuration. The configuration files are place at <strong>/etc/apache2/sites-available</strong>, pelitutkimus is for pelitutkimus.fi and gamescultures is for gamescultures.org.</p>
    <p>Debian has its special directory design for virtual host managment. To add a new website:<br />
    <ul>
    	<li>create a virtual host configuration file for that site and put the file (preferably) in <strong>/etc/apache2/sites-available</strong>. </li>
    	<li>In <strong>/etc/apache2/sites-enable</strong>, create a symbolic link to the created configuration file.</li>
    	<li>Restart apache, I usually use <i>apache2ctl graceful.</i></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3 id="6.3">6.3 Backup Policy</h3>
    <p> The backup directory on oolong3 is <strong>/backup</strong>. There are two backup scripts doing daily backup: <strong>/etc/cron.daily/automysqlbackup </strong>and <strong>~/root/back/back.pl</strong>. <strong>/etc/cron.daily/automysqlbackup</strong> creates daily, weekly and monthly database backup and stores them in <strong>/backup/db</strong>, <strong>~/root/backup/backup.pl</strong> backups <strong>/backup/db</strong>, <strong>/etc/apache2</strong>, <strong>/var/www/pelitutkimus.fi</strong>, and <strong>/var/www/gamescultures.org</strong>, and copies the generated tar.gz file to the network hard disk drive <strong>//arnika/laitos$/hyper/Projektit/oolong3_Backup/</strong> as remote backup.</p>
    <p> On oolong3, the network hard disk drive arnika is auto mounted at booting to <strong>/mnt/arnika</strong>, where <strong>/mnt/arnika/hyper/Projektit/oolong3_Backup/</strong> is a hidden directory that is only visible to Frans, Mikael and Chienting, any permission changes has to be configured by Mikael. To change the auto mount configuration, edit the file <strong>/etc/fstab</strong> and <strong>/etc/arnikapw</strong>. By now, the username and password used for connecting //arnika is Chienting's username and password, they will have to be changed in the future.</p>
    <h3 id="6.4">6.4 Pelitutkimus.fi</h3>
    <p>pelitutkimus.fi is a website providing information about game, game research and game design in Finnish. It is built by <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type Open Source 4.1 (MTOS4.1)</a>, with <a href="http://www.mollio.org/">Mollio</a> as its design template.</p>
    <p>The configuration file of Movable Type is <strong>/var/www/pelitutkimus.fi/mt/mt-config.cgi</strong>, it is automatically generated when installing Movable Type, it can also be manually modified to further meet our requirement, just remember to backup before making any changes to the file. Be sure to keep this file safe, because it also contains the database username and password used by Movable Type. Information on all configuration options can be found at <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/documentation/config">http://www.movabletype.org/documentation/config</a>. To manage pelitutkimus.fi, connect to <a href="http://www.pelitutkimus.fi/mt/mt.cgi">log in page</a>, the administrator username and password are: admin / (to be filled).</p>

    <h3 id="6.5">6.5 Gamescultures.org</h3>
    <p>gamescultures.fi is a website for creating knowledge about games cultures. It is built by <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">Mediawiki 1.11.1</a>. The configuration file of Mediawiki is <strong>/var/www/gamescultures.org/wiki/LocalSettings.php</strong>, it is automatically generated when installing Mediawiki, it can also be manually modified to further meet our requirement, just remember to backup before making any changes to the file. Be sure to keep this file safe, because it also contains the database username and password used by Mediawiki. Information on all configuration options can be found at  <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Configuration_settings">http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Configuration_settings</a>.

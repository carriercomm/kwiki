=head1 NAME

Kwiki::DNSBL - Blocks edit from ip addresses in DNS Blackhole lists

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Much of the current WikiSpam comes from open proxies. This plugin
queries a number of DNS blackhole lists to check if users are using
an open proxy and blocks them if they do.

It uses L<Net::DNSBLLookup> which also queries blackhole lists that
report if an ip address is known to have an open e-mail relay. This
plugin blocks these users anyway, even though WikiSpam has nothing to
do with normal e-mail spam.

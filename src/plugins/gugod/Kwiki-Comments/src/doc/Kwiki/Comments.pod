=head1 NAME

Kwiki::Comments - Post comments to a page

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Kwiki::Comments> is a L<Kwiki> plugin that allow anyone to leave
comments to a Page, just like Slash comments or MT comments. To use
this plugin, simply install L<Kwiki>, and this module from CPAN, and
do:

    # echo 'Kwiki::Comments' >> plugins
    # kwiki -update

Currently you'll need to have L<DBD::SQLite> module installed to use
this module. Maybe in the future, we can support more kinds of database
back-end.

And now your site is ready to have comments. But, comments
are not shown automatically. You'll have to append this line:

    {comments}

To whatever pages that are allow comment.

The basic idea is that, some wiki pages can be protected, only admin
can edit them. On those protected pages, comments becomes the only way
for anybody to give feedbacks, but sometimes you don't even want a
feedback. That's why you'll need to clearly specify if you want
a comment form attach to the page, or not.

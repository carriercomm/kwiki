Kwiki::Navigation_Toolbar - Navigation Toolbar

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin provids an extra toolbar other then L<Kwiki::Toolbar>,
and you may manage it from web interface. Combine with
privacy feature provided from Kwiki 0.37, you may make a
simple content-manage system.

The idea is to have a special page contain the content of menu;
by default it's called C<KwikiNavigationToolbar>, it is not
created automatically, you'll have to edit it after you install
this plugin. This syntax inside is quite stright-forward:
one menu-item each line, contain a KwikiPageName, and an optional
label, seperated by a comma. For example:

    HomePage
    Research,My Research Topic
    PerlStudy,Study Perl

This create a menu with 3 items associated to "HomePage",
"Research","PerlStudy" respectively. If labels are not given,
page name are displayed.

Currently,L<Kwiki::Theme::ColumnLayout> make use of this plugin;
if you want to add it into your theme, place the following line
into somewhere of C<kwiki_screen.html>:

    [% hub.navigator_toolbar.html %]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Basiclly a Kwiki site lets all people and randomly edit any page they
want.  This plugin provide a simple mechanism to let people have their
own page, and no one else can edit.

The idea is simple: each new page have an associated token, if one
page is created with that token, then, upon editing, users will be
asked to input the token value. The modified content will be stored
only if the token is correct.

if you don't give a token upon new page creation, then this page will
be a token-less page, which would leave it just as a unprotected page,
and everone can modify it.

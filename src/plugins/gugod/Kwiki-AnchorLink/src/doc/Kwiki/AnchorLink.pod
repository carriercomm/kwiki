=head1 NAME

Kwiki::AnchorLink - Provide Anchor wafl phrase to kwiki

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    {anchor: mybio}
    == My Bio

    ......

    {anchorlink: mybio Look at My Bio}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This kwiki plugin provide one missing function to kwiki: anchor
points.  With {anchor: <anchor_name>} wafl phrase you could create a
anchor link at the point. It actually generate something like this:

    <a name="mybio"></a>

Then, in the other place of the same page, you could use {anchorlink:
<name> <title>} to put a link to that anchor, it'll generate something
like this:

    <a href="#mybio">Look at My Bio</a>

The first agrument to {anchorlink} is taken as the name of anchor
point, and the rests are used as the link title.

So far it doesn't not generate corss-page anchor link, so please
be patient, or send me patch. :)

=head1 NAME

  Kwiki::Session - Session support in your Kwiki plugin

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Install Kwiki::Session as a plugin
    > kwiki -add Kwiki::Sesssion

    # Return a CGI::Session object
    my $session = $self->hub->session->load;

=head1 DESCRIPTION


This class help out when a Kwiki plugin writer wants session support.  It has
only one method called "load", which will automatically recover the correct
session id, and create one if necessary. "load" method returns a
C<CGI::Session> object, so please read the documentation in CGI::Session in
order to use this object.

Please that, this module itself is also a kwiki plugin, and has to be installed
to your kwiki site if you want your own module to use it very easily. If you
put "Kwiki::Session" in your "plugins" file, you can just use this line
to retrieve your session:

    my $session = $self->hub->session->load;

Otherwise, it would take like this long to load it:

    sub init {
        $self->hub->config->add_field('session' => 'Kwiki::Session');
    }

For simple purpose, just put "Kwiki::Session" into your "plugins" file. It
doesn't provide any extra actions or widgets or any templates, just convienent
access programming interface.

Kwiki::Keywords - Keywords for Kwiki

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  kwiki -add Kwiki::Keywords

Kwiki::Keywords provides keywords (or tags) for each Kwiki Page. You
can then browse by keyword. If a page is edited by someone with
a Kwiki UserName, the name will be added as a keyword. This feature
can be turned off by setting

in config.yaml.

=head1 CREDITS

This module was created on the fly at YAPC::NA 2005 in Toronto by
everyone at the Kwiki presentation.

Ricardo SIGNES provided the keywords_no_auto patch, made it
so keywords are only written to writable pages, and added support
for related tags and display of tag intersections.

=head1 NAME

Kwiki::Yahoo - Wafl Phrase for including RSS feeds in a Kwiki Page

=head1 DESCRIPTION

  {yahoo-doc <query> |args}

Kwiki::Yahoo uses the Yahoo::Search module to use the Yahoo API
for web, video, image, news, local, spelling, and related searches.

This is a simple proof of concept that probably has many roads for
improvement. A lot of flexibility would be gained by accessing the
Results directly rather than using the generated HTML.

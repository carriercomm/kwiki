=head1 NAME

Kwiki::Backlinks - Maintain and display a simple database of links to the current page

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Kwiki::Backlinks uses the file system to keep track of which pages in 
a wiki link to which pages in the same wiki. That data is then used
to display on every page in the wiki. This is considered a nice
feature by some and an absolute requirement for enabling emergent 
understanding by others.

You can see Kwiki::Backlinks in action at L<http://www.burningchrome.com/wiki/>

This code also happens to demonstrate a novel use of Spoon hooks.

The backlinks database may also be used as a generic database of linking
activity in the wiki. L<Kwiki::Orphans> uses the database to reveal
pages which have no incoming links. The backlinks for any given page 
can be found the the following incantation:

    @backlinks = $self->hub->backlinks->get_backlinks_for_page($page->id);

This returns a list of page ids.

=head1 NAME

Kwiki::Formatter::Note - Allows you to put "Notes" in your wiki.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module will take a note and add special formatting so that the note will
stand out out on the page. Notes are common idioms in books and useful for
Wiki manuals.

In your wiki markup (the uppercase is important):

    NOTE: This is really important!

The HTML produced should be something like:

    <table class="note"><tr>
        <th>Note</th>
        <td>This is really important!</td>
    </tr></table>

With the default stylesheets this will look something like:

    |------|---------------------------|
    | Note | This is really important! |
    |______|___________________________|

Kwiki::Archive::Cvs - Kwiki Page Archival Using CVS

=head1 SYNOPSIS

A Kwiki::Archive that stores changes in a CVS repository.

This is a direct modification of Brian Ingerson's Kwiki::Archive::Rcs module
to work with CVS instead of RCS. It was written and tested against the 0.33
release of Kwiki.

quiet' operation).

Install the module, then add 'Kwiki::Archive::Cvs' to the plugins file and
run 'kwiki -update'.

=item *

Make sure the 'database' directory holds a checked-out CVS sandbox.

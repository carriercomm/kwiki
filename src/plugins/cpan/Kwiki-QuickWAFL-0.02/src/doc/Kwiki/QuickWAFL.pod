=head1 NAME

Kwiki::QuickWAFL - Causes configured WALF methods to have their contents
processed by the normal Kwiki formatting engine.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Add your WAFL method to the config file. You can do this by putting the
following in config.yaml:

	blocks
	- example
	- workaround

Add as many items you want to the list. After editing the config file run:

	kwiki -update

This will inform the Kwiki engine of your new WAFL phrases.

Then do:

	.example
	Some text *here*
	.example

Change the CSS to make .example look like you want and you are done.

=head1 TODO

I would like to be able to do the same thing with WALF Phrases but I was unable
to get the Kwiki formatting engine to process the contents inside a WALF Phrase.

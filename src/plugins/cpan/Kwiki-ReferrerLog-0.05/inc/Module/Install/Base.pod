=item _top()

Returns the top-level B<Module::Install> object.

=cut
=item admin()

Returns the C<_top> object's associated B<Module::Install::Admin> object
on the first run (i.e. when there was no F<inc/> when the program
started); on subsequent (user-side) runs, returns a fake admin object
with an empty C<AUTOLOAD> method that does nothing at all.

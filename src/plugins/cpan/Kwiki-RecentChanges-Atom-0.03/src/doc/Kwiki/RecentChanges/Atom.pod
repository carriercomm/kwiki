=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-kwiki-recentchanges-atom@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org>.  I will be notified, and then you'll automatically
be notified of progress on your bug as I make changes.

=head1 TODO

The documentation for L<XML::Atom::Feed> doesn't suggest that it populates a
lot of fields typical to an Atom feed.  I need to investigate to see if that 
module creates a very simple feed or if there are a lot of undocumented 
methods.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

James Peregrino's Kwiki::RecentChangesRSS helped this module along.

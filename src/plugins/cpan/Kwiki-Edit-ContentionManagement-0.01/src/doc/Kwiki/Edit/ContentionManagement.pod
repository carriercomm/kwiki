=head1 NAME

Kwiki::Edit::ContentionManagement - Allows the user to do something when
contention occurs besides starting over!

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=over

=item

User 1 starts editing the page

=item

User 2 starts editing the page.

=item

User 1 saves their changes

=item

User 2 saves their changes

=item

User 2 changes don't get saved yet. Instead they get a message telling them
about the contention but their text box still exists and they can still edit
the content. The make a few edits incorporating the changes already on the page
and then hit save.

=item

User 2's changes squash any change that User 1 made (hope User 2 got all of
them from User 1).

=item

User 2 is not cursing Kwiki because it now lets them submit their changes
instead of simply displaying an error message and clearing out 3 hours of work
they just did because User 1 made a quick change while User 2 was editing the
stupid file!
